# docker-ethminer

This is a docker harness for running four separate ethereum miners for four separate nVidia GPUs.

This works with both `x86_64` and `ppc64le` architecture hosts with nVidia GPUs.

# Dependencies:

Make sure you have `nvidia-docker` installed first.

The primary reason is the creation of the `nvidia_driver_384.81` volume.

Your installed nvidia driver version may differ from `384.81`.

# usage:

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to:

- Replace the `384.81` with your currently installed nvidia driver version.
- Replace `2c0859b9312d9bf93e1b4cae8d47d59030a75a9f` with your own ethereum address.

If you have fewer than 4 GPUs, please delete the extra container stanzas in that yml file as well.

Then run:

    ARCH=$(uname -p) docker-compose up -d
